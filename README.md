TouchIDIssue
============

An Issue I found when developing apps that using TouchID to unlock.

You can reproduce simply like this.

Put your finger on the touch area and then start this application. You will find that after user passed the authentication and jump to the second view controller, the alert requiring fingerprint is still there...
